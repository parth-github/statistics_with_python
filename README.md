# Concepts of Statistics implemented in Python

## Objective: To demonstrate various statiscal concepts using python program and statistical package.
### Various concepts covered are as follow:
#### Types of variables:
    - Categorical, Qualitative:
        - Nominal
        - Ordinal(orderd, grouped, rating)
    - Numerical, Quantitave:
        - Discrete
        - Continuous

- Central Tendency: Mean, Media, Mode,
- Variability: Variance, Standard Deviation, Co-efficient of variation
- Assymetry: Skewness - positioning of outliers, Kurtosis
- Measures of Relationship: Covariance, Co-efficient of Correlation
  
- Random Variable, Sample Space, Sample Size, Event, Probability
- Bernoulli Process
- Probability Distributions:
    - For Continuous Random Variable:-
        - Probability Density Function (PDF)
        - Normal Distribution, Gaussian Distribution, Bell-shaped curve
        - Standard Normal Distribution, standardization with z-score, area under the curve probability
        - Student's T Distribution
        - Exponential Distribution
        - Chi-squared Distribution
        - F Distribution
    - For Discrete Random Variable:-
        - Probability Mass Function (PMF)
        - Binomial Distribution
        - Poisson's Distribution
        - Pascal Distribution
    
- Hypothesis Testing
    - 1-tailed
    - 2-tailed
    - Two samples
    - Estimators - Confidence Interval
    - Significant value, alpha, Type-I Error, True Negative
    - Type-II Error, beta, False Positive, Accepting the False
    - Power Curve - Rejecting the False

  - Regression
  - Time-series Analysis
